<p>
I am a digital artist utilizing video, audio, photo, and code. From a young age I was always fascinated by computers; with the gift of a Visual Basic game programming book around age 8 I was plunged into a world of creating multimedia experiences. For me, the line between analytical and creative thinking is blurred- I prefer to operate in between the two.

In my time at University of North Carolina at Asheville I majored in new media, concentrating in motion media, as well as a minor in philosophy. I also took a wide variety of electives ranging from women and gender studies to computer science. I have experience with most Adobe software, the standard web programming languages and libraries, as well as Java and Python. I also have skills with videography and photography, as well as audio recording and mixing.
