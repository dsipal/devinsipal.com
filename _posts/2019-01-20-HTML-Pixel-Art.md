This project is a drawing application made using HTML and Javascript. The canvas is made using divs, which are then manipulated using JQuery. Each time a div is moused over it loses a bit of a RGB color value. There is a gradient and static effect, as well as shifting all cells of a certain lightness to a different color. Each of the effects can be used in the text console as well.
